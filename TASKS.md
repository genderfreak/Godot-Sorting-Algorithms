# Task List

Future features will include:
- More sorting methods (quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort namely)
- A display screen with boxes having height representing values, rather than the current debug screen

This will likely be impossible, as I build my current tools around very basic single stepping sorts, such as bubble sort. This is unless I refactor much of the code, I assume, to fit other sorting methods, which I would probably not do and would rather just restart, I think. But we'll see.
